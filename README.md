WHAT IT DOES
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Each Calculator comes with an array of numbers, functions, and memory features.
The Normal Calculator has 0-9,+,-,*,/,.,= as well as M+,M-,MR,MC and C.
-> . will create a decimal number
-> M+ will add to memory
-> M- will subtract from memory
-> MR will show memory
-> MC will clear the memory

The Binary Calculator has 1,0,+,*,/,%,= as well as <<,>>,&&,||,~ and MR,MC,M+,M- and C
-> << shifts one bit to the left (makes 1 -> 10)
-> >> shifts one bit right (makes 10 -> 1)
-> && performs the bitwise & operator (1000 & 1101 = 1000)
-> || performs the bitwise || operator (1000 & 11 = 1101)
-> ~ performs the invert operator (makes 1010 -> (0)101)
-> Memory works the same
