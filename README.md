WHAT IT DOES
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Each Calculator comes with an array of numbers, functions, and memory features.
The Normal Calculator has 0-9,+,-,*,/,.,= as well as M+,M-,MR,MC and C. 
-> . will create a decimal number.
-> M+ will add to memory.
-> M- will subtract from memory.
-> MR will show memory.
-> MC will clear the memory.

The Binary Calculator has 1,0,+,*,/,%,= as well as <<,>>,&&,||,~ and MR,MC,M+,M- and C.
-> << shifts one bit to the left (makes 1 -> 10).
-> >> shifts one bit right (makes 10 -> 1).
-> && performs the bitwise & operator (1000 & 1101 = 1000).
-> || performs the bitwise || operator (1000 & 11 = 1101).
-> ~ performs the invert operator (makes 1010 -> (0)101).
-> Memory works the same
